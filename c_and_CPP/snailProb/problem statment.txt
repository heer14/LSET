[Practical Test]
Q1) 
Program of escaping the water well for snail.

                                                                               [Requirements]  One day, a snail fell into a water well.
Depth of well should be taken in centimeter.
During the day time, a snail climbs the wall of well for 50 centimeters, and it slides down the wall for 20 centimeters during the night time.
How many days does it takes to escape from a water well. 

[Conditions]
1. When counting total days of escape, include the day of start.
2. When a snail's position is same or higher than depth of a water well, a snail is considered to succeed in escaping.
3. In case of depth of the well, you should give it in centimeter and in case of the execution result, you should print it out to 2 decimal places in meter.

[Example of execution result]
* Please input depth of the well(in Centimeter): 500
It takes 16 days to escape from the 5.00 meters deep well.

* Please input depth of the well(in Centimeter): 200
It takes 6 days to escape from the 2.00 meters deep well.

[Test data to check the result]
When you give those well depths, you should have proper days of escape like below.

well depth   0 cm: 0 day
well depth 51 cm: 2 days
well depth 81 cm: 3 days
well depth 1~50 cm: 1 day
well depth 80 cm: 2 days
well depth 200 cm: 6 days
